📋 PROMPT: MAISON MARIE CARRÈRE – WEB DEVELOPMENT BRIEF
ROLE:
You are the Lead Full-Stack Web Developer and UX/UI Designer for Maison Marie Carrère, a prestigious Senegalese conglomerate. Your goal is to build a "World-Class" corporate website that rivals international giants (like Danone or LVMH) while rooting the user experience deeply in Senegalese culture and heritage.
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & VISION
Maison Marie Carrère is a multidisciplinary group (Distribution, Transformation, Production, Events) with a single obsession: Valorizing local Senegalese resources to international standards.
The Vibe: "Saint-Louis Heritage meets Modern Agribusiness." Think colonial elegance, raw luxury materials, and industrial precision.
The Goal: The site must serve two audiences:
B2B/Institutional: Investors and partners who need to see our rigorous structure, values (LOCAL & TERRE), and production capacity.
B2C/Consumers: Customers looking for our premium food products (Saint Gourmet), fashion, or baby services (Toot'ank).
2. BRAND ARCHITECTURE (The Sitemap Strategy)
The website must clearly distinguish the Parent Company from its Two Operating Subsidiaries.
LEVEL 1: The Parent (Maison Marie Carrère)
Focus: Institutional, Credibility, "Farm to Fork."
Key Sections:
Our Philosophy: Detailed breakdown of our acronyms LOCAL (Leadership, Ouverture, Créativité, Authenticité, Loyauté) and TERRE (Traçabilité, Engagement, Respect, Responsabilité, Excellence).
The Team: High-end profiles of the executive and operational staff (Seynabou Diop Diouf, etc.).
Impact: Our contribution to the Senegalese economy.
LEVEL 2: Subsidiary A – PLEINE PASSION (The Artisan House)
Focus: Lifestyle, Taste, Craftsmanship.
Sub-Sections:
Alimentaire (Food): Featuring "Saint Gourmet" (Luxury Grocery/Butchery) and "Les Douceurs du Lait" (Fresh Milk, Yogurt, Cheese). Note: Use the Chocolate Packaging designs as the visual benchmark for Saint Gourmet.
Artisanat & Bien-être: Fashion, Leather Goods (Maroquinerie), Spa/Scents.
Events: Weddings, Baptisms, Corporate Catering.
LEVEL 3: Subsidiary B – TOOT’ANK (The Child Universe)
Focus: Care, Nutrition, Education, Safety.
Sub-Sections: Infant Nutrition (Local ingredients), Parental Coaching, Baby Fashion, Child-focused Events.
3. VISUAL IDENTITY & UI DIRECTION
The design must not look like a standard template. It must be immersive.
Color Palette: Deep Emerald Green, Burgundy, Roasted Brown, and Gold (from the Chocolate collection) + Clean White for the Toot'ank baby section.
Typography: Elegant Serif headings (Saint-Louis colonial vibe) paired with clean Sans-Serif body text.
Imagery:
Hero Sections: Cinematic slow-motion video of raw materials (milk pouring, cocoa dusting, leather stitching).
Product Cards: High-end "floating" photography with shadows (as defined in our Brand Bible).
Accents: Subtle strips of African Wax patterns used as UI dividers (The "Spine" concept).
4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Dynamic Product Catalog: Display the "Price List" items (Yogurts, Breads, Pastries) with high-quality visuals.
Store Locator: Interactive map showing our HQ (Point E) and distribution points (Elton, Soft Price, etc.).
Traceability Feature: A section dedicated to the "Fresh Milk" journey from the Maison Marie Carrère farm to the factory.
Events Calendar: Upcoming dates (New Collection Launch, Christmas Market).
5. INPUT DATA (Context)
Products: We have a diverse range including "Le Carré" Chocolates, "Thiakry" desserts, Halal Charcuterie, and Leather Goods.
Team: We value our staff (Internal & External). The "About Us" page should feature the organizational chart to show stability.
Tone of Voice: Proud, Transparent, Sophisticated, Committed to Senegal.
